`nflfastR` is a set of functions to efficiently scrape NFL play-by-play
data. `nflfastR` expands upon the features of nflscrapR:

-   The package contains NFL play-by-play data back to 1999
-   As suggested by the package name, it obtains games **much** faster
-   Includes completion probability (`cp`), completion percentage over
    expected (`cpoe`), and expected yards after the catch (`xyac_epa`
    and `xyac_mean_yardage`) in play-by-play going back to 2006
-   Includes drive information, including drive starting position and
    drive result
-   Includes series information, including series number and series
    success
-   Hosts [a repository of play-by-play data going back to
    1999](https://github.com/nflverse/nflfastR-data) for very quick
    access
-   Features models for Expected Points, Win Probability, Completion
    Probability, and Yards After the Catch (see section below)
-   Includes a function `update_db()` that creates and updates a
    database

We owe a debt of gratitude to the original
[`nflscrapR`](https://github.com/maksimhorowitz/nflscrapR) team, Maksim
Horowitz, Ronald Yurko, and Samuel Ventura, without whose contributions
and inspiration this package would not exist.

## Installation

The easiest way to get nflfastR is to install it from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=nflfastR) with:

``` r
install.packages("nflfastR")
```

To get a bug fix or to use a feature from the development version, you
can install the development version of nflfastR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/nflverse/nflfastR/) with:

``` r
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("nflverse/nflfastR")
```

## Usage

We have provided some application examples in the **[Getting
Started](https://www.nflfastr.com/articles/nflfastR.html)** article.
However, these require a basic knowledge of R. For this reason we have
the **[nflfastR beginnerâ€™s
guide](https://www.nflfastr.com/articles/beginners_guide.html)**, which
we recommend to all those who are looking for an introduction to
nflfastR with R.

You can find column names and descriptions in the **[Field
Descriptions](https://www.nflfastr.com/articles/field_descriptions.html)**
article, or by accessing the `field_descriptions` dataframe from the
package.

## Data repository

Even though `nflfastR` is very fast, **for historical games we recommend
downloading the data from
[here](https://github.com/nflverse/nflfastR-data)**. These data sets
include play-by-play data of complete seasons going back to 1999 and we
will update them in 2020 once the season starts. The files contain both
regular season and postseason data, and one can use game\_type or week
to figure out which games occurred in the postseason. Data are available
as .csv.gz, .parquet, or .rds.

## nflfastR models

`nflfastR` uses its own models for Expected Points, Win Probability,
Completion Probability, and Expected Yards After the Catch. To read
about the models, please see [this post on Open Source
Football](https://www.opensourcefootball.com/posts/2020-09-28-nflfastr-ep-wp-and-cp-models/).
For a more detailed description of the motivation for Expected Points
models, we highly recommend this paper [from the nflscrapR team located
here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.00998.pdf).

Here is a visualization of the Expected Points model by down and
yardline.

Here is a visualization of the Completion Probability model by air yards
and pass direction.

`nflfastR` includes two win probability models: one with and one without
incorporating the pre-game spread.

-   To Nick Shoemaker for [finding and making available JSON-formatted
    NFL play-by-play back to
    1999](https://github.com/CroppedClamp/nfl_pbps) (`nflfastR` uses
    this source for 1999 and 2000 and previously also used it for
    2001-2010)
-   To Lau Sze Yui for developing a scraping function to access
    JSON-formatted NFL play-by-play beginning in 2001
-   To Aaron Schatz and Football Outsiders for providing charting data
    to correctly mark scrambles in the 2005 season
-   To Lee Sharpe for curating a resource for game information
-   To Timo Riske, Lau Sze Yui, Sean Clement, and Daniel Houston for
    many helpful discussions regarding the development of the new
    `nflfastR` models
-   To Zach Feldman and Josh Hermsmeyer for many helpful discussions
    about CPOE models as well as Peter Owen for many helpful suggestions
    for the CP model
-   To Florian Schmitt for the logo design
-   The many users who found and reported bugs in `nflfastR` 1.0
-   And of course, the original
    [`nflscrapR`](https://github.com/maksimhorowitz/nflscrapR) team,
    Maksim Horowitz, Ronald Yurko, and Samuel Ventura, whose work
    represented a dramatic step forward for the state of public NFL
    research
