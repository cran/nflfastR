Clean Play by Play Data
}
\details{
Build columns that capture what happens on all plays, including
penalties, using string extraction from play description.
Loosely based on Ben's nflfastR guide (\url{https://www.nflfastr.com/articles/beginners_guide.html})
but updated to work with the RS data, which has a different player format in
the play description; e.g. 24-M.Lynch instead of M.Lynch.
The function also standardizes team abbreviations so that, for example,
the Chargers are always represented by 'LAC' regardless of which year it was.
Starting in 2022, play-by-play data was missing gsis player IDs of rookies.
This functions tries to fix as many as possible.
