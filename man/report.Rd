\usage{
report(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[nflreadr:sitrep]{nflreadr::nflverse_sitrep}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{pkg}}{a character vector naming installed packages, or \code{NULL}
(the default) meaning all nflverse packages. The function checks internally
if all packages are installed and informs if that is not the case.}
    \item{\code{recursive}}{a logical indicating whether dependencies of \code{pkg} and their
dependencies (and so on) should be included.
Can also be a character vector listing the types of dependencies, a subset
of \code{c("Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo", "Suggests", "Enhances")}.
Character string \code{"all"} is shorthand for that vector, character string
\code{"most"} for the same vector without \code{"Enhances"}, character string \code{"strong"}
(default) for the first three elements of that vector.}
    \item{\code{redact_path}}{a logical indicating whether options that contain "path"
in the name should be redacted, default = TRUE}
  }}
}
\description{
This function gives a quick overview of the versions of R and
the operating system as well as the versions of nflverse packages, options,
and their dependencies. It's primarily designed to help you get a quick
idea of what's going on when you're helping someone else debug a problem.
