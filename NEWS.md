# nflfastR 4.0.0

## Breaking changes

### Changed Functions

* Deprecated the arguments `source` and `pp` all across the package. Using them will cause a 
warning. Parallel processing has to be activated by choosing an appropriate `future::plan()` before
calling the relevant functions. For more information please see [the package documentation](https://www.nflfastr.com/reference/nflfastR-package.html).
* The function `build_nflfastR_pbp()` will now run `decode_player_ids()` by default (can be deactivated with the argument `decode = FALSE`). 
* The function `build_nflfastR_pbp()` will now run `add_xpass()` by default and add the new variables `xpass` and `pass_oe`.
* The functions `fast_scraper()` and `build_nflfastR_pbp()` now allow the output of `fast_scraper_schedules()` directly as input so it's not necessary anymore to pull the `game_id` first.

### New Functions and Variables

* Added the new function `load_pbp()` that loads complete seasons into memory for fast access of the play-by-play data.
* Added the new variables `rushing_yards`, `lateral_rushing_yards`, `passing_yards`, `receiving_yards`, `lateral_receiving_yards` to fix an old bug where `yards_gained` gets overwritten on plays with laterals (#115).
* Added columns `vegas_wpa` and `vegas_home_wpa` which contain Win Probability Added from the spread-adjusted WP model
* Added column `out_of_bounds`
* Added columns `fantasy`, `fantasy_id`, `fantasy_player_name`, and `fantasy_player_id` that indicate the rusher or receiver on the play
* Added columns `tackle_with_assist`, `tackle_with_assist_1_player_id`, `tackle_with_assist_1_player_name`, `tackle_with_assist_1_team`, `tackle_with_assist_2_player_id`, `tackle_with_assist_2_player_name`, `tackle_with_assist_2_team`

### Models and Miscellaneous

* Tuned spread-adjusted win probability model one final (?) time. Expected points is now no longer 
required for `calculate_win_probability()`
* Added field descriptions `vignette("field_descriptions")` with a searchable list of all nflfastR variables
* Switched data source for 2001-2010 to what is used for 2011 and on
* All models have been moved to the [fastrmodels](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fastrmodels) package
* Added the data frames `?field_descriptions` and `?stat_ids` to the package

## Minor improvements and fixes

* Fix bug where `fixed_drive` and `series` weren't updating after muffed punt (#144)
* Fix bug induced by fixing the above (#149)
* Fix bug where some special teams plays were incorrectly being labeled as pass plays (#125)
* Fix bug where points for safeties were given to the `defteam` instead of the `posteam` (#152)
* Fix bug where a muffed punt TD was given to the wrong team in a 2011 Jaguars game (#154)
* Win probability is now calculated prior to PAT attempts rather than using WP on the ensuing kickoff
* Improved performance of internal functions that speed up the rebuilding process in `update_db()`
(added `qs` and `curl` to dependencies)
* Fixed a bug where `calculate_expected_points()` and `calculate_win_probability()` duplicated some existing variables instead of replacing them (#170)
* Fixed a bug where `penalty_type` wasn't `"no_play"` although it should have been (#172)
* Fixed a bug where `penalty_team` could be incorrect in games of the Jaguars in the seasons 2011 - 2015 (#174)
* Fixed a bug related to the calculation of `epa` on plays before a failed pass interference challenge in a few 2019 games (#175)
* Fixed a bug related to lots of fields with `NA` on offsetting penalties (#44)
* Fixed a bug in `epa` when possession team changes at end of 1st or 3rd quarter (#182)
* Fixed a bug where various functions have left open connections
* `vegas_wp` is now `NA` on final line since there is no possession team


# nflfastR 3.2.0

## Models

* Performance update for win probability model with point spread (`vegas_wp`)
* Added `yardline_100` as an input to both win probability models (not having it included was an oversight)

## Minor improvements and fixes

* Fixed a bug where `series` was increased on PATs
* Fixed a bug affecting the week 10 Raiders-Broncos game
* Added the column `team_wordmark` - which contains URLs to the team's wordmarks - to the included data frame `?teams_colors_logos`

# nflfastR 3.1.1

## New features

### Database Function `update_db()`

* The argument `force_rebuild` of the function `update_db()` is now of hybrid 
type. It can rebuild the play by play data table either for the whole nflfastR 
era (with `force_rebuild = TRUE`) or just for specified seasons 
(e.g. `force_rebuild = 2019:2020`).
The latter is intended to be used for running seasons because the NFL fixes bugs
in the play by play data during the week and we recommend to rebuild the current 
season every Thursday.
* Fixed a bug where `update_db()` disconnected the connection to a database provided 
by the argument `db_connection` (#102)
* Fixed a bug where `update_db()` didn't build a fresh database without providing
the argument `force_rebuild`
* `update_db()` no longer removes the complete data table when a numeric argument 
`force_rebuild` is passed but only removes the rows within the table (#109)

### New Functions

* Added the new function `build_nflfastR_pbp()`, a convenient wrapper around 
multiple nflfastR functions for an easy creation of the nflfastR play-by-play data set
* Added a function that applies our experimental expected pass model, `add_xpass()`,
that creates columns `xpass` and `pass_oe`

## Minor improvements and fixes

* More fixes for `fixed_drive` which was not incrementing properly on drives
that began following a timeout
* Fixed more bugs in EPA and win probability on PATs and kickoffs with penalties
* Fixed a bug where scoring probabilities weren't adding to 1 on field goal 
attempts near the end of a half
* Messages to the user are now created with the new dependency `usethis`
* Fixed bug where plays with "backward pass" in play description were counted as 
pass plays (`pass` = 1)
* Fixed missing kick distance on touchbacks and blocked punts (#53)
* Added the option `fast` (either `TRUE` or `FALSE`) to the function 
`decode_player_ids()` to activate the high efficient C++ decoder of the package 
[`gsisdecoder`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=gsisdecoder)

# nflfastR 3.0.0

## Breaking changes

* `fast_scraper_roster()` is finally back! It loads NFL roster of a given season.
* Added the function `decode_player_ids()` to decode all player IDs to the 
commonly known GSIS ID format (00-00xxxxx)

## New features

* Add option `source = "old"` to `fast_scraper()` to enable scraping of old source.
This is mostly useless as it doesn't work for 2020 and provides less info
* Added new option `db_connection` to `update_db()` to allow advanced users to
use other DBI drivers, such as `RMariaDB::MariaDB()`, `RPostgres::Postgres()` or 
`odbc::odbc()` (please see [dbplyr](https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dbplyr.html)
for more information)

## Minor improvements and fixes

* `clean_pbp()` now fixes some bugs in jersey numbers
* `clean_pbp()`, `add_qb_epa()` and `add_xyac()` can now handle empty data frames
* Fix empty line causing `fast_scraper()` to fail (affects multiple games of the 2020 season)
* Fix bug in `fixed_drive` that counted PAT after defensive TD as its own drive
* Fixed a bug which caused too high number of tackles in special cases
* Fixed a bug where CPOE was NA when targeting players with apostrophe in last name

# nflfastR 2.2.1

* Fix `add_xyac()` breaking with some old packages
* Fix `add_xyac()` and `add_qb_epa()` calculations being wrong for some failed 4th downs
* Updated Readme with ep and cp model plots
* Updated `vignette("examples")` with the new `add_xyac()` function
* Added xYAC model to `vignette("nflfastR-models")`
* Added variables `fixed_drive` and `fixed_drive_result` to the output of 
`fast_scraper()` because the NFL-provided drive info is extremely buggy
* Added variable `series_result`
* `clean_pbp()` now adds 4 new variables `passer_jersey_number`, 
`rusher_jersey_number`, `receiver_jersey_number` and `jersey_number`. These can 
be used to join rosters. 
* Fixed incorrect `timeout_team`, `return_team`, `fumble_recovery_1_team` for JAX
games from 2011-2015
* Re-trained EPA model with `fixed_drive` and corrections to `timeout_team`

# nflfastR 2.2.0

* New function `add_xyac()` which adds the following columns associated with expected yards after
the catch (xYAC): `xyac_epa`, `xyac_success`, `xyac_fd`, `xyac_mean_yardage`, `xyac_median_yardage`

# nflfastR 2.1.3

* Fixed a bug in `series_success` caused by bad `drive` information provided by NFL

# nflfastR 2.1.2

* Added the following columns that are available 2011 and later: `special_teams_play`, `st_play_type`, `time_of_day`, and `order_sequence`
* Added `old_game_id` column (useful for merging to external data that still uses this ID: format is YYYYMMDDxx)
* The `clean_pbp()` function now adds an `aborted_play` column
* Fixed a bug where pass plays with a penalty at end of play were classified as `play_type` = `no_play` rather than `pass`
* Fixed bug where EPA on defensive 2 point return was -0.95 instead of -2.95
* Fixed some remaining failed challenge plays that incorrectly had 0 for EPA
* Updated the included dataframe `teams_colors_logos` for the interim name of 
the 'Washington Football Team' and the corresponding logo urls.
* Some internal code improvements causing the required `tidyselect` version
to be >= 1.1.0

# nflfastR 2.1.1

### Functions

* `clean_pbp()` now standardizes player IDs across the old (1999-2010) and new 
(2011+) data sources. Player IDs once again uniquely identify players, and each 
unique player has one unique ID (as they did before the NFL data source change):
    * For players whose careers finished before 2011, their IDs remain the same
    * For players who played in both eras or only in the new era, their ID is 
    the new ID
    * For example, Akili Smith (ID: 00-0015082) and Alex Smith 
    (ID: 32013030-2d30-3032-3334-3336b638d37d) are both abbreviated as "A.Smith" 
    but can be distinguished by their IDs, with Akili showing what the old 
    format ID looks like, and Smith the new one
    * Standardization is realized by using an [ID map](https://github.com/guga31bb/nflfastR-data/blob/master/roster-data/legacy_id_map.csv)
    available in the data repo created with [this script](https://github.com/guga31bb/nflfastR-data/blob/master/roster-data/legacy_id_map.R)
    
* `clean_pbp()` now removes all variables it is about to create to make sure 
nothing unexpected can happen

### Miscellaneous

* Added minimum version requirements to some package dependencies because 
installation broke for some users with outdated packages

* Made a minor bug fix to catch more out-of-order plays and fixed a bug where some
plays were being incorrectly dropped in older seasons

* Standardized team names (e.g. `SD` --> `LAC`) in some columns we had missed

# nflfastR 2.1.0

### Models

* Removed `week` from Expected Points models along with an update of
`vignette("nflfastR-models")` and `vignette("examples")`

### Functions

* Added function `update_db()` which adds all completed games to a SQLite database
* Added function `calculate_win_probability()` 
* Added new examples to `vignette("examples")` demonstrating the usage of the
above mentioned functions

### Bugs

* Fixed a problem with inconsistent data types of the variable
`drive_real_start_time` pre and post 2011
* Fixed a problem where some `game_id`s were overwritten during the play by play parsing
* Fix some more WP bugs on kickoffs with penalties and rare play description

### Miscellaneous

* `fast_scraper()` now loads the raw game data from a separate raw data repo
* Completely overhauled the entire code base to directly implement
[tidy evaluation](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html) using 
`.data` from the [rlang](https://rlang.r-lib.org/) package (this is a major 
code change that takes some getting used to but we need it in preparation of 
a future release)

# nflfastR 2.0.6

* Fixed a problem where defensive two point conversions were not counted
* Kneels on kickoffs are no longer counted as qb kneels
* Variable `yards_gained` more precisely defined
* Bugfixes for more games with out of order of plays
* Fix bug related to EPA on plays with a failed pass interference challenge
* Added new example to `vignette("examples")` to demonstrate Expected Points 
calculator `calculate_expected_points()`
* Fix for WP on 2-pt conversion negated by penalty
* Add more variables (containing team names) to team standardization in `clean_pbp()`
* Fix WP for onside kicks

# nflfastR 2.0.5

* Fix yet another bug caused by NFL providing plays out of order
* Fix bugs related to penalties on PATs and kickoffs
* Fix bugs related to NFL providing wrong scoring team on defensive touchdowns 
in older games involving the Jaguars
* Fix some minor issues related to wrong `first_down_rush` and `return_touchdown`
* Improved error handling of `fast_scraper()` for not yet played games
* Improved variable documentation and prepared for new website
* Improved performance for dplyr v1.0.0
* Rebuilt EP and WP models due to bugfixes in the underlying data in the versions
2.0.3, 2.0.4 and 2.0.5

# nflfastR 2.0.4

* Fix another bug with out of order plays
* Fix bug affecting cumulative totals for WPA, air_WPA and yac_WPA 
* Fix bug affecting cumulative totals for air_EPA and yac_EPA

# nflfastR 2.0.3

* Fix for NFL providing plays out of order
* Fix for series not incrementing following defensive TD

# nflfastR 2.0.2

* Fixed a bug in the series and series success calculations caused by timeouts
following a possession change
* Fixed win probability on PATs

# nflfastR 2.0.1

* Added minimum version requirement on `xgboost` (>= 1.1) as the recent `xgboost` update 
caused a breaking change leading to failure in adding model results to data

# nflfastR 2.0.0

### Models
* Added new models for Expected Points, Win Probability and Completion Probability 
and removed `nflscrapR` dependency. This is a **major** change as we are stepping away 
from the well established `nflscrapR` models. But we believe it is a good step forward.
See `data-raw/MODEL-README.md` for detailed model information.

* Added internal functions for `EPA` and `WPA` to `helper_add_ep_wp.R`.

* Added new function `calculate_expected_points()` usable for the enduser.

### Functions
* Completely overhauled `fast_scraper()` to make it work with the NFL's new server 
backend. The option `source` is still available but will be deprecated since there
is only one source now. There are some changes in the output as well (please see below).

* `fast_scraper()` now adds game data to the play by play data set courtesy of Lee Sharpe. 
Game data include:
away_score, home_score, location, result, total, spread_line, total_line, div_game, 
roof, surface, temp, wind, home_coach, away_coach, stadium, stadium_id, gameday

* `fastcraper_schedules()` now incorporates Lee Sharpe's `games.rds`.

* The functions `fast_scraper_clips()` and `fast_scraper_roster()` are deactivated 
due to the missing data source. They might be reactivated or completely dropped 
in future versions.

* The function `fix_fumbles()` has been renamed to `add_qb_epa()` as the new name
much better describes what the function is actually doing.

### Miscellaneous

* Added progress information using the `progressr`package and removed the 
`furrr` progress bars.

* `clean_pbp()` now adds the column `ìd` which is the id of the player in the column `name`. 
Because we have to piece together different data to cover the full span of years,
**player IDs are not consistent between the early (1999-2010) and recent (2011 onward)
periods**.

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

* Fixed several bugs inhereted from `nflscrapR`, including one where EPA was missing 
when a play was followed by two timeouts (for example, a two-minute warning followed by a timeout),
and another where `play_type` was incorrect on plays with declined penalties.

* Fixed a bug, where `receiver_player_name` and `receiver` didn't name the correct
players on plays with lateral passes.

### Play-by-Play Output
The output has changed a little bit.
